I love cheese, but it has no place in a true desi omelette. 

## Ingredients

- 2 desi eggs (organic, free range)
- tomato, diced
- coriander, diced
- onion, diced
- chilli, diced

## Spice

- 1/4 tsp desi chilli (or thai) 
- 1/4 tsp salt 
- pinch of tumeric/haldi (optional)

## Directions

- break eggs into a bowl, whisk, add all the veggies as you see fit
- add spices
- whisk a bit
- fry half the mixture on a flat pan, flip and don't fold over

Serve with toast or paratha.

Note: If you diced a whole onion/coriander/tomato, that will do for 2-3 serves. Obviously you need at least a chilli per serve.

Note: this recipe is as good as it gets, don't add no grama masala or anything.
